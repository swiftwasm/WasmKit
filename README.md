# WasmKit

**WasmKit** is a standalone and embeddable WebAssembly runtime implementation written in Swift.

## Usage

The best way to learn how to use WasmKit is to look at the [Examples](./Examples) directory.

### Command Line Tool

WasmKit provides a command line tool to run WebAssembly binaries compliant with WASI.

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/swiftwasm/WasmKit.git
$ cd WasmKit
$ swift run wasmkit-cli run ./Examples/wasm/hello.wasm
Hello, World!
```

### As a Library

#### Swift Package Manager

You can use WasmKit as a [Swift Package Manager](https://www.swift.org/documentation/package-manager/) dependency.

Run the following commands to add the dependency:

```
swift package add-dependency https://github.com/swiftwasm/WasmKit --up-to-next-minor-from 0.1.6
swift package add-target-dependency WasmKit <your-package-target-name> --package WasmKit
```

You can also add the following snippet manually to your `Package.swift` file:

```swift
dependencies: [
    // ...other dependencies
    .package(url: "https://github.com/swiftwasm/WasmKit.git", .upToNextMinor(from: "0.1.6")),
],
// ...other package configuration
targets: [
    // ...other targets
    .target(
        name: "<your-package-target-name",
        dependencies: [.product(name: "WasmKit", package: "WasmKit")],
    )
]
```

You can find API documentation on the [Swift Package Index](https://swiftpackageindex.com/swiftwasm/WasmKit/main/documentation/wasmkit).

## Features

- [Reasonably fast](./Documentation/RegisterMachine.md#performance-evaluation)
- Minimal dependencies
    - The core runtime engine depends only on [swift-system](https://github.com/apple/swift-system).
    - No Foundation dependency
- Compact and embeddable
    - Debug build complete in 5 seconds[^1]
- Batteries included
    - WASI support, WAT parser, etc.


## Supported Platforms

WasmKit engine works on all major platforms supported by Swift. It is continuously tested on macOS, Ubuntu, Amazon Linux 2, and Windows,
and should work on the following platforms:

- macOS 10.13+, iOS 12.0+, tvOS 12.0+, watchOS 6.0+
- Amazon Linux 2, Debian 12, Ubuntu 22.04+, Fedora 39+
- Windows 10+

## Minimum Supported Swift Version

The minimum supported version is Swift 6.0, which is the version used to bootstrap the Swift toolchain in [ci.swift.org](https://ci.swift.org/).

## Testing

To run the WasmKit test suite, you need to checkout the test suite repositories first.

```sh
# Checkout test suite repositories
$ ./Vendor/checkout-dependency
# Run tests
$ swift test
```
