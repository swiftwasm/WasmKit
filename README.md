# WasmKit

**WasmKit** is a standalone and embeddable WebAssembly runtime implementation written in Swift.

## Usage

The best way to learn how to use WasmKit is to look at the [Examples](./Examples) directory.

### Command Line Tool

WasmKit provides a command line tool to run WebAssembly binaries compliant with WASI.

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/swiftwasm/WasmKit.git
$ cd WasmKit
$ swift run wasmkit-cli run ./Examples/wasm/hello.wasm
Hello, World!
```

### As a Library

#### Swift Package Manager

You can use WasmKit as a [Swift Package Manager](https://www.swift.org/documentation/package-manager/) dependency by adding the following to your `Package.swift` file:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/swiftwasm/WasmKit.git", from: "0.1.0"),
],
```

You can find API documentation on the [Swift Package Index](https://swiftpackageindex.com/swiftwasm/WasmKit/main/documentation/wasmkit).

## Features

- [Reasonably fast](./Documentation/RegisterMachine.md#performance-evaluation)
- Minimal dependencies
    - The core runtime engine depends only on [swift-system](https://github.com/apple/swift-system).
    - No Foundation dependency
- Compact and embeddable
    - Debug build complete in 5 seconds[^1]
- Batteries included
    - WASI support, WAT parser, etc.


## Supported Platforms

WasmKit engine works on all major platforms supported by Swift. It is continuously tested on macOS, Ubuntu, and Windows,
and should work on the following platforms:

- macOS 10.13+, iOS 12.0+, tvOS 12.0+, watchOS 6.0+
- Ubuntu 20.04+
- Windows 10+

## Minimum Supported Swift Version

The minimum supported Swift version of WasmKit is 5.8, which is the version used to bootstrap the Swift toolchain in [ci.swift.org](https://ci.swift.org/).

## Testing

To run the WasmKit test suite, you need to checkout the test suite repositories first.

```sh
# Checkout test suite repositories
$ ./Vendor/checkout-dependency
# Run tests
$ swift test
```
